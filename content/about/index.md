### TL;DR
I'm a technology entreprenuer with almost 20 years of experience. I'm currently a project manager studying for my PMP, dabbling with Hugo websites at night.

### Long version
My name is Kevin Cooke. I started CharlotteCarShows.com in 2015 after moving back to NC. I'm a developer and started programming at a young age using Yahoo GeoCities. I enjoy helping people market their events online and hope you find these resources useful.
